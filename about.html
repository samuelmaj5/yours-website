                <div class="team-intro">
                    <p>We're Samuel Majbruch, Victoire Heyworth, and Alexandre Bansard—three friends who realized that the best recommendations don't come from algorithms, but from the people we trust most.</p>

                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>It all started when one of us was stuck trying to find a good movie, and after hours of searching, a quick call to a friend solved the problem instantly with the perfect recommendation. That moment sparked an idea: What if there was a platform where we could easily share the movies, books, music, and other content we love with the people we care about, and discover new things through them?</p>
                    <p>That's how YOURS was born.</p>
                    <p>We wanted to create something that goes beyond appearances, where your profile reflects your real personality—through the content you enjoy. Whether it's your favorite movies, a book you couldn't put down, or a new song you have on repeat, YOURS lets you share your unique tastes with your friends and see theirs.</p>

                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>With YOURS, you don't just get recommendations; you get them from the people who matter. We built this app to connect people through the media they love and to help you discover more of the content that feels like it was made for you.</p>
                    <p>It started as a simple idea between friends, and after months of hard work, sleepless nights, and brainstorming, we've brought it to life. We're excited to share YOURS with you and can't wait to see how it helps you connect, discover, and show who you really are.</p>
