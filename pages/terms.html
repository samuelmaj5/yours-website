                    <p>Welcome to YOURS!</p>
                    <p>At YOURS, our mission is to create a platform where users can express their real tastes and personalities, going beyond appearances. We want to provide services and technologies that enable you to share your passions and connect with others authentically.</p>
                    <p>To make this happen, it's important that we clarify what it means to be part of the YOURS community. This document outlines what you can expect from us, what we expect from you, and how we can make YOURS better for everyone.</p>
                    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms"), along with our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> and Community Standards, make up our User Agreement. Throughout this document, some terms may have specific definitions, so they should be interpreted consistently with the User Agreement. If you find anything unclear or need more information, feel free to contact us.</p>
                    <p>If you're not willing to agree to these Terms, please do not use our Services. By using YOURS, you are agreeing to be bound by the User Agreement.</p>

                    <h2>1. Who Can Use Our Services</h2>
                    <p>Our "Services" include all aspects of the YOURS mobile applications, website, and the software and systems powering them.</p>
                    <p>YOURS is for real people (because authenticity matters). To use our Services, you must:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be at least 13 years old. Depending on your location, if you are under the age of consent in your country, a parent or guardian may need to provide consent.</li>
                        <li>If creating an account on behalf of another person or entity (such as a company, organization, or government), you must have the legal authority to act on behalf of that entity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When we say "you" in this agreement, it refers to both you, the individual user, and, where applicable, the entity for which you are creating the account.</p>

                    <h2>2. Data Protection and Privacy</h2>
                    <p>Your privacy is very important to us. Our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how we handle it when you use our Services. By using YOURS, you consent to the collection, processing, storage, and transfer of your information as described in the Privacy Policy. This may include transfers to countries outside your own.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>3. Content</h2>
                    <p>YOURS is about sharing authentic content. Be kind, respectful, and responsible when you post.</p>
                    <p>"Content" refers to profile information, posts, reactions, comments, and any other media shared through our Services.</p>
                    <p>You are responsible for ensuring that the Content you share does not violate any laws, regulations, or the User Agreement. By sharing Content, you guarantee that you have the right to do so.</p>
                    <p>If we find Content that violates our rules, we have the right to remove it without prior notice. This includes, but is not limited to, harassment, threats, defamation, hate speech, child exploitation, and intellectual property violations.</p>
                    <p>You own the Content you share on YOURS but grant us a license to use it:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Private Content:</strong> Content shared only with your friends will not be used by YOURS without your explicit consent.</li>
                        <li><strong>Public Content:</strong> Content shared publicly on YOURS gives us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, copy, reproduce, modify, publish, and distribute that Content across any media. By sharing publicly, you understand that YOURS may make your Content available to others for promotional, commercial, or other purposes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>4. Reporting Violations</h2>
                    <p>We are not required to monitor all Content shared on YOURS, but we want to maintain a safe and positive space. If you see Content that violates laws, rules, or our User Agreement, you can report it through the app or on our website.</p>
                    <p>If you believe your intellectual property rights have been infringed, please report it via our intellectual property reporting form.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>5. Termination of Services</h2>
                    <p>We may suspend or terminate your account if you share Content that violates our rules or use the platform in a way that infringes on others' rights or violates laws.</p>
                    <p>We typically operate a three-strike policy. For each violation, your account may be temporarily suspended. After three violations, your account will be permanently banned.</p>
                    <p>Some violations, such as sharing Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), result in immediate and permanent suspension without the three-strike process.</p>
                    <p>If your account has been suspended or terminated, you may appeal by contacting our support team.</p>
                    <p>To protect the integrity of our platform, we may also temporarily suspend accounts showing suspicious or abnormal activity.</p>
                    <p>Inactive accounts may be deleted after 2 years, but we will notify you before taking this step.</p>
                    <p>You are free to delete your account at any time through the app's settings.</p>

                    <p>If any part of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the rest will remain in full effect.</p>
